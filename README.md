Yet another Brainfuck interpreter

Like the world needed another one, right?

Re: single branch
I wanted to experiment with timing a typical multi-file project as the 'master' branch,
versus a single file approach like this branch.

In this case, on my machine, the timing for 'single' was roughly half of 'master'.

The test was not scientific, but does seem to indicate that linking is problematic.
