# Brainfuck
Yet another Brainfuck interpreter

Like the world needed another one, right?

Re: to_c

This was born out of the 'single' branch. I wanted to see if c-like code would be faster to compile
than c++. The branch as it stands compiles in about the same amount of time as 'single', but that
doesn't really say anything as it's still c++ code. I will need to change the string handling and
external file code to make the experiment ring truer.
